type: Anomaly
description: This analytic looks for a commandline that change the file owner to root
  using chown utility tool. This technique is commonly abuse by adversaries, malware
  author and red teamers to escalate privilege to the targeted or compromised host
  by changing the owner of their malicious file to root. This event is not so common
  in corporate network except from the administrator doing normal task that needs
  high privilege.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*chown *'
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: chown
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '* root *'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

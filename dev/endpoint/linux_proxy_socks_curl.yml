description: The following analytic identifies curl being utilized with a proxy based
  on command-line arguments - -x, socks, --preproxy and --proxy. This behavior is
  built into the MetaSploit Framework as a auxiliary module. What does socks buy an
  adversary? SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination
  domain name rather than an IP address. The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in RFC 1928.
  It is an incompatible extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for
  authentication and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used
  for DNS lookups. The protocols, and a proxy itself, allow an adversary to evade
  controls in place monitoring traffic, making it harder for the defender to identify
  and track activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on proxy usage internally.
  Filter as needed.

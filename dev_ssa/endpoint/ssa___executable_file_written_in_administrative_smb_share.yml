description:
  The following analytic identifies executable files (.exe or .dll) being
  written to Windows administrative SMB shares (Admin$, IPC$, C$). This represents
  suspicious behavior as its commonly used by tools like PsExec/PaExec and others
  to stage service binaries before creating and starting a Windows service on remote
  endpoints. Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse administrative shares for lateral
  movement and remote code execution. The Trickbot malware family also implements
  this behavior to try to infect other machines in the infected network.
data_source:
  - Windows Event Log Security 5145
search:
  selection1:
    file.path|endswith:
      - .exe
      - .dll
    file.type: File
    share:
      - \\\\*\\C$
      - \\\\*\\IPC$
      - \\\\*\\admin$
    access_mask: 2
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 5145 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required. Also enable the object Audit access success/failure in your group policy.
known_false_positives:
  System Administrators may use looks like PsExec for troubleshooting
  or administrations tasks. However, this will typically come only from certain users
  and certain systems that can be added to an allow list.

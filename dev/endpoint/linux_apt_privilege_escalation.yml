description: Advanced Package Tool, more commonly known as APT, is a collection of
  tools used to install, update, remove, and otherwise manage software packages on
  Debian and its derivative operating systems, including Ubuntu and Linux Mint. If
  sudo right is given to the tool for user, then the user can run system commands
  as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*apt*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

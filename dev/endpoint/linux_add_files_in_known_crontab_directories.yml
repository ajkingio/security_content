status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious file creation in known
  cron table directories. This event is commonly abuse by malware, adversaries and
  red teamers to persist on the target or compromised host. crontab or cronjob is
  like a schedule task in windows environment where you can create an executable or
  script on the known crontab directories to run it base on its schedule. This Anomaly
  query is a good indicator to look further what file is added and who added the file
  if to consider it legitimate file.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search:
  selection1:
    TargetFilename:
    - '*/etc/cron*'
    - '*/var/spool/cron/*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can create file in crontab
  folders for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false
  positives.

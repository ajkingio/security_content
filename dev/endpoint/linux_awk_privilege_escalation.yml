description: Awk is mostly used for processing and scanning patterns. It checks one
  or more files to determine whether any lines fit the specified patterns, and if
  so, it does the appropriate action. If sudo right is given to AWK binary for the
  user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*awk*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*BEGIN*system*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.

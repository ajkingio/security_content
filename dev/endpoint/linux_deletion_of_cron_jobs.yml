description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of cron job in a linux machine.
  This technique can be related to an attacker, threat actor or malware to disable
  scheduled cron jobs that might be related to security or to evade some detections.
  We also saw that this technique can be a good indicator for malware that is trying
  to wipe or delete several files on the compromised host like the acidrain malware.
  This anomaly detection can be a good pivot detection to look for process and user
  doing it why they doing. Take note that this event can be done by administrator
  so filtering on those possible false positive event is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search:
  selection1:
    TargetFilename: /etc/cron.*
    Filesystem.action: deleted
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

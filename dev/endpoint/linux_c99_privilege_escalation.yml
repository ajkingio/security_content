description: The c99 utility is an interface to the standard C compilation system;
  it shall accept source code conforming to the ISO C standard. The system conceptually
  consists of a compiler and link editor. If sudo right is given to ruby application
  for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root
  shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-wrapper*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*c99*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

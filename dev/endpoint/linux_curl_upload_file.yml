description: The following analytic identifies curl being utilized with the -F or
  --form, --upload-file, -T, -d, --data, --data-raw, -I and --head switches to upload
  AWS credentials or config to a remote destination. This enables uploading of binary
  files and so forth. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name
  with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
  the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get attached
  in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just get the contents
  for that text field from a file. This technique was utlized by the TeamTNT group
  to exfiltrate AWS credentials.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required. In addition to AWS credentials,
  add other important files and monitor. The inverse would be to look for _all_ -F
  behavior and tune from there.

description: RPM Package Manager is a free and open-source package management system.
  The name RPM refers to the .rpm file format and the package manager program itself.
  RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline
  package format of the Linux Standard Base. If sudo right is given to rpm utility
  for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root
  shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*lua:os.execute*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*rpm*--eval*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.

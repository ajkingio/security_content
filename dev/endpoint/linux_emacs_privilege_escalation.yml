description: EMACS is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility.
  The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible,
  customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". If sudo right is given
  to EMACS tool for the user, then the user can run special commands as root and possibly
  get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*--eval*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*emacs*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

description: The Linux make command is used to build and maintain groups of programs
  and files from the source code. In Linux, it is one of the most frequently used
  commands by the developers. It assists developers to install and compile many utilities
  from the terminal. If sudo right is given to make utility for the user, then the
  user can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.

search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*--eval*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*make*-s*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

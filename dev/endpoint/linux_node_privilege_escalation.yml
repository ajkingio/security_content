description: Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that is open-source,
  cross-platform, runs on the V8 engine, and executes JavaScript code outside of a
  web browser. It was created to help create scalable network applications. If the
  binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges
  and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-e*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*node*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*child_process.spawn*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*stdio*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives are present based on automated tooling or system
  administrative usage. Filter as needed.

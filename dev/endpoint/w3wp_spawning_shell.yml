type: TTP
description: This query identifies a shell, PowerShell.exe or Cmd.exe, spawning from
  W3WP.exe, or IIS. In addition to IIS logs, this behavior with an EDR product will
  capture potential webshell activity, similar to the HAFNIUM Group abusing CVEs,
  on publicly available Exchange mail servers. During triage, review the parent process
  and child process of the shell being spawned. Review the command-line arguments
  and any file modifications that may occur. Identify additional parallel process,
  child processes, that may highlight further commands executed. After triaging, work
  to contain the threat and patch the system that is vulnerable.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Baseline your environment before production. It is possible
  build systems using IIS will spawn cmd.exe to perform a software build. Filter as
  needed.

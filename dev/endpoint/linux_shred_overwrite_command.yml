description: This analytic is to detect a shred process to overwrite a files in a
  linux machine. Shred Linux application is designed to overwrite file to hide its
  contents or make the deleted file un-recoverable. Weve seen this technique in industroyer2
  malware that tries to wipe energy facilities of targeted sector as part of its destructive
  attack. It might be some normal user may use this command for valid purposes but
  it is recommended to check what files, disk or folder it tries to shred that might
  be good pivot for incident response in this type of destructive malware.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*-n*'
    - '*-u*'
    - '*-z*'
    - '*-s*'
    Image|endswith: shred
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

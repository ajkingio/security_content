description: The following analytic identifies the use of curl on Linux or MacOS attempting
  to download a file from a remote source and pipe it to bash. This is typically found
  with coinminers and most recently with CVE-2021-44228, a vulnerability in Log4j.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-s *'
    Image|endswith: curl
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*bash*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*|*'
  condition: (selection1) or selection2 or selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon for Linux, you will need to ensure mapping is
  occurring correctly. If the EDR is not parsing the pipe bash in the command-line,
  modifying the analytic will be required. Add parent process name (Processes.parent_process_name)
  as needed to filter.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filtering may be
  required.

description: cpulimit is a simple program which attempts to limit the cpu usage of
  a process (expressed in percentage, not in cpu time). This is useful to control
  batch jobs, when you don't want them to eat too much cpu. If sudo right is given
  to the program for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly
  get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*-l*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*cpulimit*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*-f*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to look for possible enumeration of local network configuration.
  This technique is commonly used as part of recon of adversaries or threat actor
  to know some network information for its next or further attack. This anomaly detections
  may capture normal event made by administrator during auditing or testing network
  connection of specific host or network to network.

    Image|endswith:
    - arp

    - netstat
    - firewall-cmd

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

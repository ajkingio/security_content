description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious deletion of a critical
  folder in Linux machine using rm command. This technique was seen in industroyer2
  campaign to wipe or destroy energy facilities of a targeted sector. Deletion in
  these list of folder is not so common since it need some elevated privileges to
  access some of it. We recommend to look further events specially in file access
  or file deletion, process commandline that may related to this technique.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '* -rf *'
    Image|endswith: rm
  selection2:
    CommandLine:
    - '*/boot/*'
    - '*/var/log/*'
    - '*/etc/*'
    - '*/dev/*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

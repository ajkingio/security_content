type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a possible access or modification of /etc/sudoers
  file. "/etc/sudoers" file controls who can run what command as what users on what
  machine and can also control whether a specific user need a password for particular
  commands.  adversaries and threat actors abuse this file to gain persistence and/or
  privilege escalation during attack on targeted host.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*/etc/sudoers*'
    Image|endswith:
    - cat
    - nano*
    - vim*
    - vi*
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

description: BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
  small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
  you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. If sudo right is given to BusyBox
  application for the user, then the user can run system commands as root and possibly
  get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*sh*'
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*busybox*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*sudo*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

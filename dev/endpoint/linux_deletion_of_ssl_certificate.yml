status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of ssl certificate in a linux machine.
  attacker may delete or modify ssl certificate to impair some security features or
  act as defense evasion in compromised linux machine. This Anomaly can be also a
  good indicator of a malware trying to wipe or delete several files in a compromised
  host as part of its destructive payload like what acidrain malware does in linux
  or router machines. This detection can be a good pivot to check what process and
  user tries to delete this type of files which is not so common and need further
  investigation.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 11
search:
  selection1:
    TargetFilename: /etc/ssl/certs/*
    Filesystem.action: deleted
  selection2:
    TargetFilename:
    - '*.pem'
    - '*.crt'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

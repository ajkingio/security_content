type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies based on process execution the modification
  of SSH Authorized Keys. Adversaries perform this behavior to persist on endpoints.
  During triage, review parallel processes and capture any additional file modifications
  for review.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*/authorized_keys*'
    Image|endswith:
    - bash
    - cat
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Filtering will be required as system administrators will add
  and remove. One way to filter query is to add "echo".

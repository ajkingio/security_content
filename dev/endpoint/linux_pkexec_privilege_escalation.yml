status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies `pkexec` spawning with no command-line
  arguments. A vulnerability in Polkit's pkexec component identified as CVE-2021-4034
  (PwnKit) which is present in the default configuration of all major Linux distributions
  and can be exploited to gain full root privileges on the system.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: pkexec
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: Depending on the EDR product in use, there are multiple ways to
  "null" the command-line field, Processes.process. Two that may be useful `process="(^.{0}$)"`
  or `| where isnull(process)`. To generate data for this behavior, Sysmon for Linux
  was utilized. To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.

description: The following analytic is to detect events that attempts to disable a
  service. This is typically identified in parallel with other instances of service
  enumeration of attempts to stop a service and then delete it. Adversaries utilize
  this technique like industroyer2 malware to terminate security services or other
  related services to continue there objective as a destructive payload.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '* disable*'
    Image|endswith:
    - systemctl
    - service
    - svcadm
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

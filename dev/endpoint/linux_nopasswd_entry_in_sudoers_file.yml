type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to look for suspicious command lines that may add entry
  to /etc/sudoers with NOPASSWD attribute in linux platform. This technique is commonly
  abuse by adversaries, malware author and red teamers to gain elevated privilege
  to the targeted or compromised host. /etc/sudoers file controls who can run what
  commands users can execute on the machines and can also control whether user need
  a password to execute particular commands. This file is composed of aliases (basically
  variables) and user specifications.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*NOPASSWD:*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

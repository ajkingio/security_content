status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic looks for suspicious commandline that redirect the stdout
  or possible stderror to dev/null file. This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware
  where it redirect the possible output or error while modify the iptables firewall
  setting of the compromised machine to hide its action from the user. This Anomaly
  detection is a good pivot to look further why process or user use this un common
  approach.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*&amp;&gt;/dev/null*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
